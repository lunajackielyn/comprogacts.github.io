      <p>My name is Jackielyn Luna. I live in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan. I have 4 sibling and I'm the middle child.<br>
      Some of my favorite things to do are read fiction stories, 
      listen to music, watching sunsets and sunrise, <br> and ride public transportation (jeepneys and motorcycle)#notojeepneyphaseout.
       These are activities that I <br> enjoy immensely and indulge in daily. 
          My career aspirations is to become a succesful Cloud engineer. <br>
            I look up mostly to my family members, especially
      my mom, as a guiding figure in life.</p></fon
