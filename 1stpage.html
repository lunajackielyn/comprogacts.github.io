                       <p>My name is Jackielyn Luna. I live in San Jose Del Monte Bulacan. I have 4 sibling and I'm the middle child.<br>
                         Some of my favorite things to do are read fiction stories, 
                           listen to music, watching sunsets and sunrise, <br> and ride public transportation (jeepneys and motorcycle)#notojeepneyphaseout.
                             These are activities that I <br> enjoy immensely and indulge in daily. 
                              My career aspirations is to become a succesful Cloud engineer. <br>
                               I look up mostly to my family members, especially
                                 my mom, as a guiding figure in life.</p></fon
