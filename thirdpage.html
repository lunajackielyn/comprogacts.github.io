                  <font color="FFFFFF"> <p> I love travelling, traveling allows us to experience many things and explore the world in ways we never could have imagined.<br>
                      As I travel, I learn a lot of new things, such as how stunning a location may be and how the locals live there.<br> 
                        Travelling is exhausting but fullfilling at the same time. The tiredness you feel from the travel time <br>
                         will be gone so fast after you see how beautiful your destination is.
