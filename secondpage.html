                 I believe music has the ability to convey all sorts of emotion. <br>
                   Whether the emotion is Joy and happiness or sadness and despair through the rhythms, harmonies and the lyrics. <br> 
                     Music has the ability to transport me back in time Just like a time machine. <br>
                      It lets me revisit lost and favorite moments in life.</p>
